I don't really like Emacs.

This is so much harder to work with than Vim, so I will just leave it at here. I will go back to Vim in a minute after this Readme file pushed to the repo.

It is not complete, and also not that good. But, it can be a good starting point for your custom configuration.

## How to install it
<hr>
Copy <code>init.el</code> into your Emacs configuration folder (usually <code>~/.emacs.d</code>).
After that, just launch Emacs and you're good to go.
